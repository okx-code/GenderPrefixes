# GenderPrefixes

This plugin allows players to choose their gender with `/male` and `/female` which adds the permissions `gender.male` and `gender.female`, respectively.

Then, their gender can be used as a context in LuckPerms, such as `/lp group <group> meta prefix set <prefix> gender=male` to apply a certain prefix only when a player has selected their gender as male.

Messages and the default gender are configurable.
